Web Scraping

Q1. What is Web Scraping? Web Scraping is the process through which we extract data from a website, and save it in a form which is easy to read, to understand and to work on. When we say 'Easy to work on', we mean to say that the data thus extracted can be used to get a lot of useful insights and answer a lot of questions, finding answers to which would not be such an easy task, if we did not have that data stored with us in a simple and sorted manner, i.e. generally in a CSV File, an Excel File or a Database.
