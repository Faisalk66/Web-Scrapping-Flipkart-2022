# Web-Scrapping-Flipkart-Project-2022
I have done a Web Scrapping on Flipkart by using Python BeautifulSoup, Pandas, Requests, Urllib, Matplotlib.

In this Web Scrapping project we have extracted PS 5 Games data from flipkart .PS 5 Games name ratings price -etc . All the data is beaing extracted through web scraping technique with the the help of BeautifulSoup . This a quiet effcient way to deal to scrape data from website.

THE full project report can be seen in ipynb file .And the final data can be seen in excel please find all the Files in the repository.

Web Scraping

Q1. What is Web Scraping? Web Scraping is the process through which we extract data from a website, and save it in a form which is easy to read, to understand and to work on. When we say 'Easy to work on', we mean to say that the data thus extracted can be used to get a lot of useful insights and answer a lot of questions, finding answers to which would not be such an easy task, if we did not have that data stored with us in a simple and sorted manner, i.e. generally in a CSV File, an Excel File or a Database.

Q2. How does web scraping work? Web pages are built using text-based mark-up languages (HTML and XHTML), and frequently contain a wealth of useful data in text form. However, most web pages are designed for human end-users and not for ease of automated use. As a result, specialized tools and software have been developed to facilitate the scraping of web pages.
Python offers a variety of libraries that one can use to scrape the web, libraires such as Scrapy, Beautiful Soup, Requests, Urllib, and Selenium.

Project Idea In this project we will parse through the flipkart website for PS 5 Games category that are available on flipkart for purchase. We will take the price information along with the discount which is available at that time ,what is the Games Name . We will also take info about user Rating that how many review does the PS 5 Games have and the Mrp of the particular PS 5 Games. We will retrieve information from the page ‘PS 5 Games’ using web scraping: a process of extracting information from a website.Automaticaly Web scraping isn’t magic, and yet some readers may grab information on a daily basis.

Project Goal The project goal is to build a web scraper that withdraws all desirable information and assemble them into a single CSV. The format of the output CSV or .xlxs file is shown in the file:

Project Steps Here is an outline of the steps we follow.

1.Search for PS 5 Games in flipkart. 2.Copy the link and paste it into the Jupyter notebook. 3.Select the data one by one to extract. 4.Create Pages link to extract all the data .And start loop url. 5.Save and Run ,It will start extracting the data.

SUMMARY Finally, we have managed to parse ‘Flipkart PS 5 Games Data’ to get our hands on very interesting and insightful data when it comes to the PS 5 Games shoping. We have saved all the information we could extract from that website for our needs in a CSV or .xlxs file using which we can further get answers to a lot of questions we may want to ask, eg- if we want to extract the data of the best highly rated Games we can extract the data easily and put it into csv or .xlxs format. FUTURE WORK We can now work forward to explore this data more and more to fetch meaningful information out of it. With all the insights , and further analysis into the data, we can have answers to a lot of questions like –

1.Which PS 5 Games has more ratings? 2.Which has more discount on mrp? 3.Which PS 5 Games have more stars .Which PS 5 Games have free delivery available?

And the list goes on.

I have Analyse the data in bar plot using matplotlib. By using pandas i have shown the data in dataframe form.
